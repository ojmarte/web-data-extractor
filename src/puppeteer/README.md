# Puppeteer Directory Overview

The `puppeteer` directory is dedicated to managing and executing all operations related to the Puppeteer browser automation library. It provides a modular structure for browser setup, navigation, and actions.

## 📄 File Breakdown:

### 1. `index.ts`
This is the core entry point for all Puppeteer operations:
- Initializes and manages the browser session.
- Orchestrates scraping sessions based on configurations.
- Handles errors and cleanup, ensuring browser sessions are terminated appropriately.

### 2. `setup.ts`
Centralizes the Puppeteer configuration settings:
- Defines default Puppeteer settings (e.g., viewport size, headless mode).
- Provides optional configurations like proxies or custom user-agents.

### 3. `browser.ts`
Responsible for managing browser instances:
- Creates and maintains new browser instances.
- Closes browser sessions and ensures resource deallocation.
- Potentially manages multiple browser contexts for parallel scraping.

### 4. `pageActions.ts`
Encompasses common browser interactions:
- Navigating to URLs.
- Clicking elements based on selectors.
- Extracting data using various strategies.
- Utilities for waiting (e.g., waiting for elements, network idling).
- Handling page-level actions like scrolling, pagination, or iframe interactions.
